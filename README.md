# awbw

bunch of half-finished projects and stuff:
a XHKO calc (actually working and useful :D);
elo plotting;
a GUI to play the game with (need local assets);
structure to work around an ai (needs completely redoing, is v bulky & slow)


elo plotting:
run plotter() from eloplot.py and edit league, rules, name at the start of the function

XHKO calc:
freely set values in defender(), luck(), known_hp(), and attackers() then run calc() from XHKO.py

pixel art:
run pixel_art() from pixelart.py. idk
